# Spectacular AI Mapping visualization example

See replay example for how to use Replay API. This example combines it with Mapping API and serializes the output in custom format tha can be sent to Python for visualization.

* Tested platforms: Linux
* Dependencies: CMake, FFmpeg (for video input)

## Setup

* Install the Spectacular AI SDK
* Build this example using CMake:

```
mkdir target
cd target
cmake -DspectacularAI_DIR=<path/to/spectacularai-sdk/lib/cmake/spectacularAI> ..
make
```

The `-DspectacularAI_DIR` option is not needed is you have used `sudo make install` for the SDK.

## Usage

Create a new pipe with:
```
mkfifo ~/my_pipe
```

Launch python visualization and leave it running with:
```
python mapping_visu.py --file ~/my_pipe
```

And finally launch this example file with:
```
./mapping_visu -i <data_folder_here> -o ~/my_pipe
```

You should now the visualization running in Open3D window.
