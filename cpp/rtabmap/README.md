# RTAB-Map RGB-D mapping example

This example demonstrates how one could implement their own 3D mapping application on top of the SpectacularAI Mapping API.
In this example, the resulting keyframe data (RGB-D images, point clouds) and the estimated poses are input to the popular [RTAB-Map SLAM library](https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap).
RTAB-Map then builds both, a 3D model and a (re-)localization map of the environment in real-time.

## Dependencies

For non-commercial use the SDK for Intel RealSense device is available at https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk. For commercial use and support for other devices, contact us at https://www.spectacularai.com/#contact. The SDK is available for multiple OSes and CPU architectures.

Also, RTAB-Map library and its dependencies must be installed (https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/wiki/Installation).

For Ubuntu you can do it with:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libpcl-dev libopencv-dev git cmake libproj-dev libqt5svg5-dev

# (Recommended) g2o
git clone https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o.git 3rdparty/g2o
cd 3rdparty/g2o
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF -DG2O_BUILD_APPS=OFF -DG2O_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DG2O_USE_OPENGL=OFF ..
make -j4
sudo make install

git clone https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap.git 3rdparty/rtabmap
cd 3rdparty/rtabmap/build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```

## Build

To build with RealSense and OAK-D support once you've downloaded and set up the [SDK](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk).
```
mkdir target && cd target
cmake -DBUILD_REALSENSE=ON -DBUILD_OAK=ON .. && make
```

or with Azure Kinect and replay support:
```
cmake -DBUILD_K4A=ON -DBUILD_REALSENSE=ON -DBUILD_REPLAY=ON .. && make
```

## Running

With an existing dataset, run:
```
rtabmap_mapper driver # (driver options: replay, k4a, realsense, oak)
```

Optionally, you can also give the program a RTAB-Map config file with argument `--config path/to/rtabmap_config.ini`.
A config file, mainly optimized for Azure Kinect, is also provided here as `rtabmap_config.ini`.
